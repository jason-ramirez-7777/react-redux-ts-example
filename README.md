# React Redux Counter Example

## Workflow

```shell
npm start
npm test
```

## Starting the social media feed app

At the start of part three we are introduced to the goal of the next few steps: *a small social media feed app, which will include a number of features that demonstrate some real-world use cases.*

This starts with *a pre-configured starter project that already has React and Redux set up, includes some default styling, and has a fake REST API*.

[Here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-essentials-example-app) is the starting point codebase.

We will have to diff the current counter app code and see what needs to be added to get to this point.

In the counter app there are two directories in the src:

- app
- features/counter

In the redux-essentials-example-app there is:

- api
- app
- components

Begin by copying the api and components directories here.

In tha app directory, there is also a new file:

src/app/Navbar.js

Copy that file, but change the extension to .tsx.  Do the same for src\components\Spinner.tsx.

The store.js has an empty reducer, so that doesn't need to change here.

Next, use the App.js in the App.tsx here.  This shows that we will need to install react-router-dom.

Then, our first issue:

import Switch
Module '"react-router-dom"' has no exported member 'Switch'.ts(2305)
No quick fixes available

This code is old.  There is a comment from Dec 3, 2021: *Use Routes instead of Switch.*

That's an easy *switch* to make.  But then there is another error:

Type '{ exact: true; path: string; render: () => Element; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & RouteProps'.
  Property 'exact' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & RouteProps'.ts(2322)

The version we are using:

```json
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-redux": "^8.0.5",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.4.3",
```

The Redux example:

```json
    "react": "^17",
    "react-dom": "^17",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.4",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.1.2",
```

So that's the problem.  Use a simple example from router 6, then just use the styles from index.css and the app runs and looks good.

## Fixing the tests

Next, the App.tsx test is failing.

Remember, we are looking for the work "Learn".  Change that to "Redux" but still an error:

TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element with the text: Redux.

The original getByText contained a regex.

```tsx
test('renders learn react link', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );

  expect(getByText(/learn/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

I can see that there are different formats for it also.

We could use a data-testid.  Since there is no test in the redux-essentials-example-app, it's up to us.

This will work for now:

```tsx
test('renders learn react link', () => {
  const { container } = render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );
  expect(container).toHaveTextContent("Redux");
});
```

That's something I saw in the comments of [this issue](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/410) on the testing-library GitHub.  It works, so time to move on.

There are no tests also for the new code.  There eventually should be for the api/client.js and api/server.js and maybe the spinner, but since this is TDD, there is no point in going back at this point and testing that working code.  Time to move on.

## Getting started with the Redux Toolkit counter example

The Redux Essentials tutorial has 7 pages.

In [Part 1: Redux Overview and Concepts](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts), there is an overview of Redux and the key concepts of State Management, Immutability, Terminology and Data Flow.

The next page [Redux App Structure](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure) goes over the classic counter app which I have discussed previously in my blog for Angular, but not React.

In [Part 3: Basic Redux Data Flow](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-3-data-flow) they start showing how to build a small social media feed app.  This will be covered in another blog post where I apply Typescript and TDD to that process.

This article is about parts 1 & 2 as they provide the foundation for the next parts.

### The Counter example

We will build a counter application to add or subtract from a number via buttons.

The app is begun in the tutorial like this:

```shell
npx create-react-app redux-essentials-example --template redux
```

However, this does not use TypeScript.  Using TypeScript as well as unit testing using TDD is the goal of this article.

### Redux + TypeScript template

The command we will use is shown [in the getting started section](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started):

npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript

Bear in mind, this little nugget takes some time.  It took about five minutes on my trusty 2019 Dell laptop.  Here is the output:

```shell

Happy hacking!
```

Now we have an app with .ts files instead of .js files, and .tsx instead of .jsx.

Run the app with 'npm start' and we see the counter example already working.

After this is the step 2 tutorial there is a section on [Using the Counter App with the Redux DevTools](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure#using-the-counter-app).

A section on [Application Contents and structure](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure#application-contents).

A discussion of app/store.js and [Creating Slice Reducers and Actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure#creating-slice-reducers-and-actions)
 shows the features/counter/counterSlice.js

This goes over the Rules of Reducers, Reducers and Immutable Updates and shows the Redux Toolkit's createSlice function which lets you write immutable updates an easier way: *createSlice uses a library called Immer inside. Immer uses a special JS tool called a Proxy to wrap the data you provide, and lets you write code that "mutates" that wrapped data. But, Immer tracks all the changes you've tried to make, and then uses that list of changes to return a safely immutably updated value*

It contrasts a  handwrittenReducer with a reducerWithImmer which is all of one line.

Writing Async Logic with Thunks shows the incrementAsync example code. Here is the vanilla Javascript file:

```js
export const incrementAsync = amount => dispatch => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount))
  }, 1000)
}
```

Here is the Typescript version we have:

```ts
export const incrementAsync = createAsyncThunk(
  'counter/fetchCount',
  async (amount: number) => {
    const response = await fetchCount(amount);
    // The value we return becomes the `fulfilled` action payload
    return response.data;
  }
);
```

createAsyncThunk is part of the [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk).  We don't get to see that as part of this tutorial trail until [Part 5: Async Logic and Data Fetching](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-5-async-logic).

There is also a section on the Counter.js component file.

Now, time for the tests.  

## Unit Tests

Out of the box we have a the usual src\App.test.tsx as well as a specification test src\features\counter\counterSlice.spec.ts file.

Run 'npm test' and we see this output:

```shell
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        4.246 s
```

In the usual src\App.test.tsx there is already a TypeScript error on this line:

```ts
src\App.test.tsx

```ts
expect(getByText(/learn/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
```

Mouseover of getByText and see this:

```txt
const getByText: (id: Matcher, options?: SelectorMatcherOptions | undefined) => HTMLElement
Avoid destructuring queries from `render` result, use `screen.getByText` insteadeslinttesting-library/prefer-screen-queries
```

We can fix that error by doing this:

```ts
  render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );
  expect(screen.getByText("Learn")).toBeInTheDocument();
```

This should be the first commit we make for this new repo:

```shell
git add .
git commit  -m "avoiding destructuring queries from render result in the App.test.tsx and using screen.getByText instead"
```

The src\features\counter\counterSlice.spec.ts file:

```ts
describe('counter reducer', () => {
  const initialState: CounterState = {
    value: 3,
    status: 'idle',
  };
  it('should handle increment', () => {
    const actual = counterReducer(initialState, increment());
    expect(actual.value).toEqual(4);
  });
```

The above expect line is testing what happens in the Counter.tsx file on the button:

```tsx
onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
```

### Root State and Dispatch Types​

The count from the store is created like this:

```tsx
import { useAppSelector, useAppDispatch } from '../../app/hooks';
import { selectCount,} from './counterSlice';
export function Counter() {
  const count = useAppSelector(selectCount);
```

In the hooks.ts file:

```ts
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

Compare this to the vanilla Javascript version which looks like this:

```js
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectCount } from './counterSlice';
export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(selectCount);
```

As you can see, there is now an extra step there in the useSelector process.

TypedUseSelectorHook is discussed in the [Usage with TypeScript](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/usage-with-typescript) section of the React Redux website.

Since React-Redux is written in TypeScript now, this helper function as the docs say make it *easier to write typesafe interfaces between your Redux store and your React components.*

So the useAppDispatch and useAppSelector are there to *create pre-typed versions of the useDispatch and useSelector hooks for usage in your application.*  This is done in a separate file as they are variables, not types, and this file allows you to import them into any component file that needs to use the hooks and avoids potential circular import dependency issues.

There is also a section called [Typing Hooks Manually​](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/usage-with-typescript) which I wont cover.

### Store types

One other thing that is different is that there are types exported in the app/store.ts file:

```ts
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
```

This are not in the vanilla Redux example.  About this the above link says: *extract the RootState type and the Dispatch type so that they can be referenced as needed. Inferring these types from the store itself means that they correctly update as you add more state slices or modify middleware settings.*

There is a discussion of using connect with hooks which the counter example doesn't have.  At the end there are some helpful links which will become important in the next blog post about the small social media feed app that is started in part 3.

## Original Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
